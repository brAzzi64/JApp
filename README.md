JApp
----

Draft web application for reviewing Japanese Kanji and the entries of a vocabulary notebook, mantained in a Google spreadsheet. It was written with the objectives of helping on the learning of the Japanese language and as a way to learn the different technologies involved.

The backend, written in Python with the CherryPy mini-framework grabs the data from the spreadsheet through Google's GData library, communicating with the HTML/CSS frontend using AJAX, JavaScript, JQuery and the JQuery mobile framework for part of the application.

It's deployed in Heroku:
